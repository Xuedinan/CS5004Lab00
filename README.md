:star: Additional support sources I found
  - This is a YouTube playlist with 399 episodes, it provides tons of information regarding Data structure and Algorithm, and OOP [Here it is](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFbd8KZNbe-9MNUoTVeKrIACuTrhIEFNA&si=wTKgoYZPPDAE5kWP)

  - This is another YouTube playlist with the more practical class of Java [Here it is](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmOn9nNkQxJFvyhDYx0ya4F75uTtUHA_f&si=J_cSmsael55iVlNd)

  - I found this book is popular regarding Java programming, I will use it as a supporting document while watching videos. The book name is “Head First Java: A Brain-Friendly Guide”
    
  - The last source I use very frequently is Google. Basically, I Google everything I wasn’t quite sure about and watch how other people resolve similar questions. Then I practice my own   method after careful thinking.
